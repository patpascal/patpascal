### Hi there 👋

I am Patricia, a senior **Product Designer** based in Spain. 
I like solving complex problems to develop elegant solutions with a high degree of craft, design thinking, and robust documentation to support the process.

I’m currently working at [New Relic](https://www.newrelic.com) as part of the **Design System** squad, taking care of UI components, patterns, frameworks, and documentation. Before joining the Design System, I was also part of the Dashboards and Data Visualization team, where I created seamless experiences to help developers visualize, analyze and troubleshoot their software.
