### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Patri, a lead product designer in One Core, [New Relic](https://www.newrelic.com)â€™s Design System, taking care of UI components, patterns, frameworks, and documentation. Before joining the Design System team, I worked in the Dashboards and Data Visualization team, where I gained valuable experience in crafting intuitive user experiences. Throughout my career, I have worked on diverse projects encompassing design systems, developer tools, education, and e-commerce.

I strive to solve complex problems to develop elegant solutions with a high degree of craft, design thinking, and robust documentation to support the process. I enjoy learning from my colleagues and collaborating with partners.

I live with a weird tiny cat called Curtis. In my spare time, I read, watch movies, and try to keep Curtis away from my plants.
